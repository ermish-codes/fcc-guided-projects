# FreeCodeCamp Guided Projects

This repository contains all the step-by-step projects and exercises I completed while learning web development through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## About

These projects are based on FreeCodeCamp's curriculum instructions. The aim is to practice and reinforce concepts as I progress through the lessons. Most of the code here follows the guided steps and is not original work.

## Projects Included

- Cafe Menu
- Colored Markers
- Registration Form
- (More will be added as I continue learning)

## Disclaimer

These projects are primarily for learning and practice purposes. The code closely follows FreeCodeCamp's instructions and is not meant to showcase originality or creativity but rather my learning process.

For my personal or original web development projects, please see my other repositories.
